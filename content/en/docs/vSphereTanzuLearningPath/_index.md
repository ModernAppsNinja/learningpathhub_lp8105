After you submit your file, leave the pull request page open, and wait 1-3 minutes for the validation workflow to complete. After the workflow completes, it will post a message to the pull request with the details on your digital badge award. This message will also notify your github account with a message to your github notifications, and you should recieve an email to the preferred email address in your member record file from badgr.com with a link to your digital badge award. 

If for some reason you do not recieve an email, you can create or login to a badgr.com account with the preferred email address in your member record file, and you should see your badge award in your backpack when you login. 

If you have any problems, please open an issue ticket.
